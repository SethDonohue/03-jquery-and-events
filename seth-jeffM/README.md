# jQuery Events

**Author**: Seth Donohue, Jeff Martinez
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is a blog consisting of a wide variety of articles.  It will have two filters so we can filter through the different articles by Author and Category.  When the option is chosen, we want to filter the results and display the blogs that match the filter author and category.  Each article should be in a preview format with the option to read on if the user chooses to do so.  This site should also have tab-based navigation so other parts of the site can be accessed.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
In order to build this application, we need to create a variable that stores all the information we need it to.  We need to create a function that can populate the two blog filters.  We need two separate filters to show and hide the chosen blogs.  We need a tab function that will show and hide our pages, and we need something to show partial articles that can be toggled to show the entire article.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We will be using html/css/javascript and jQuery to design the application.
